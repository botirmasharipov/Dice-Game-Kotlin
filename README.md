# Dice-Game-Kotlin
### This code is written in Kotlin and is for an Android app that simulates a dice game for two players. The app initializes variables for two buttons (rollBtn1 and rollBtn2) and two image views (diceImg1 and diceImg2). The app sets OnClickListeners for both buttons, which will be called when the buttons are clicked. The listener for rollBtn1 sets a random number between 1 and 6 to the variable randomNum and assigns the corresponding dice image to the diceImg1 using the when expression. The listener for rollBtn2 does the same thing but for the diceImg2. Overall, this code creates a simple dice game where two players can roll their own dice by clicking on the corresponding buttons and the result is displayed on the screen using the corresponding image views.
